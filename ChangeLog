- added support for verifying HMAC signatures on id tokens - it has
  already been supported for access tokens before
- fix handling of signatures using unsupported algorithms on id
  tokens. Such signatures will cause a warning to be logged but the id
  tokens are considered valid. access tokens signed with an
  unsupported algorithm are considered invalid. This is the same
  behavior as has been present in 1.4.1. See #122
- release 1.5.1

11/15/2017
- fix return of access_token when renew_access_token_on_expiry = false ; see #121

11/14/2017
- release 1.5.0

11/13/2017
- provided explicit control over whether the access token gets renewed
  on expiry. If refresh fails, the user is redirected to the OP's
  authorization endpoint.

- now uses cjson.safe when decoding JSON received from external sources for improved error handling

10/28/2017
- add id_token_hint when calling end_session_endpoint

10/27/2017
- ensured id_token_hint uses the correct query string separator when
  opts.redirect_after_logout_uri is used together with redirect_after_logout_with_id_token_hint

- add more logs

10/03/2017
